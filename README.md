# RockPaperScissors


## Description

Utililized this mini project to reinforce the vanilla javascript using window alert, prompt, and confirm. This will allow users to compete with a random computergenerated option versus their option in rock, paper, scissors. Made the HTML quite simple to focus on javascript and came out well. Learned some best practices with javascript instead of doing things the long and hard way.Below i used the following criteria:

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

Specifications
Must use the alert(), confirm(), and prompt() methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
